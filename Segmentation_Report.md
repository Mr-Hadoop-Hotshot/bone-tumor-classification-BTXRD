# Bone Tumor X-Ray Segmentation: An Experimental Comparison of U-Net Architectures

## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive experimental analysis of two deep learning models for segmenting bone tumors in X-ray images. We implemented and evaluated two variants of the U-Net architecture: a basic U-Net model and an improved U-Net with attention mechanisms. Our study focused on the BTXRD dataset, which contains 3,746 X-ray images with corresponding tumor annotations. The segmentation task aimed to precisely identify tumor regions in bone X-rays, a critical step in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the improved U-Net model with attention gates, combined with custom loss functions and optimized training strategies, achieved better performance metrics, particularly at lower prediction thresholds. This report details our methodology, architectural decisions, evaluation metrics, and future considerations for advancing bone tumor segmentation in medical imaging.

## 1. Introduction and Objectives

### 1.1 Context

Accurate segmentation of bone tumors in X-ray images represents a critical step in the diagnostic workflow for orthopedic oncology. Traditionally, this task has been performed manually by radiologists, which is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Automated segmentation through deep learning offers the potential to assist clinicians by providing faster, more consistent tumor delineation.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this experimental study were to:

1. Implement and evaluate two different segmentation architectures for bone tumor detection in X-ray images
2. Compare the performance of a basic U-Net model against an improved U-Net with attention mechanisms
3. Determine the impact of architectural choices, loss functions, and training strategies on segmentation performance
4. Identify optimal threshold values for binary mask prediction
5. Establish a foundation for future research in medical image segmentation for bone pathology

## 2. Dataset Analysis

### 2.1 Dataset Overview

The Bone Tumor X-Ray Dataset (BTXRD) contains 3,746 X-ray images with corresponding metadata. The dataset includes annotations for tumor regions, allowing for supervised training of segmentation models. Key dataset characteristics include:

- **Total images**: 3,746
- **Image format**: JPEG
- **Annotation format**: JSON files with polygon/rectangle coordinates
- **Classes**: Normal (1,879), Benign (1,525), Malignant (342)

### 2.2 Dataset Distribution

The dataset exhibits several important characteristics that influenced our modeling approach:

- **Gender distribution**: Male (56%), Female (44%)
- **Tumor type distribution**: Normal (50.1%), Benign (40.7%), Malignant (9.2%)
- **Age distribution**: Wide range from pediatric to elderly patients
- **Body part distribution**: Various skeletal regions including femur, tibia, hip bone, etc.

*Figure 3: Gender distribution across tumor types showing relatively balanced representation*

### 2.3 Annotation Analysis

A critical aspect of the dataset is the tumor annotations, which were provided in JSON format. Each annotation contains:

- Shape type (polygon or rectangle)
- Coordinates of tumor boundaries
- Image dimensions

Analysis of the annotations revealed that only 1,867 out of 3,746 images (approximately 50%) contained tumor annotations. This class imbalance represented a significant challenge for model training and required specialized approaches to prevent bias toward the majority class.

The tumor area percentage (relative to the total image area) was typically small, creating a significant foreground-background imbalance within annotated images. This spatial class imbalance necessitated specialized loss functions to ensure proper learning of tumor boundaries.

### 2.4 Anatomical Variety and Its Impact on Training

As shown in Figure 4, the dataset contains X-rays from various anatomical regions, with tibia (19.3%), femur (15.8%), and hip bone (12.7%) being the most common. This anatomical diversity presented specific challenges for the segmentation task:

1. **Varying bone structures**: Different bones have distinct shapes, densities, and surrounding tissue contexts, requiring the model to generalize across these variations
2. **Different radiographic presentations**: Tumors in different anatomical regions manifest with varying radiographic features
3. **Inconsistent image orientations**: X-rays from different body parts have different standard views (e.g., AP, lateral) and positioning
4. **Region-specific artifacts**: Each region has typical artifacts and overlapping structures

This anatomical heterogeneity likely contributed to the model's difficulty in achieving high segmentation performance, as it needed to learn features that generalize across these various anatomical contexts. Models trained on more homogeneous datasets (e.g., only tibia or only femur) might achieve better performance due to the reduced variability.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Preprocessing

Our preprocessing pipeline included several key steps:

1. **Image standardization**: Resizing all images to 224×224 pixels
2. **Mask generation**: Converting polygon/rectangle annotations to binary masks
3. **Normalization**: Scaling pixel values to [0,1] range
4. **Train-validation-test split**: 70%/15%/15% stratified by tumor type
5. **Data balancing**: Creating a more balanced dataset with tumor and non-tumor samples

### 3.2 Addressing Class Imbalance

The dataset presented two significant imbalance challenges:

1. **Image-level imbalance**: Only about 50% of images contained tumor annotations
2. **Pixel-level imbalance**: Within tumor-containing images, tumor pixels typically occupied less than 5% of the total image area

To address these issues, we implemented several strategies:

```python
def create_balanced_dataset(X, Y, balance_ratio=0.5):
    """Create a more balanced dataset by including more tumor samples"""
    tumor_indices = []
    no_tumor_indices = []
    
    for i in range(len(Y)):
        if np.sum(Y[i]) > 100:  # Has substantial tumor area
            tumor_indices.append(i)
        else:
            no_tumor_indices.append(i)
    
    # Balance the dataset
    if len(tumor_indices) > 0:
        n_tumor = len(tumor_indices)
        n_no_tumor = int(n_tumor / balance_ratio - n_tumor)
        n_no_tumor = min(n_no_tumor, len(no_tumor_indices))
        
        selected_no_tumor = np.random.choice(no_tumor_indices, n_no_tumor, replace=False)
        balanced_indices = tumor_indices + selected_no_tumor.tolist()
        
        return X[balanced_indices], Y[balanced_indices]
```

For the improved model, we implemented:

1. **Balanced sampling**: Using the above function with balance_ratio=0.3, ensuring tumor-containing images were well-represented in training
2. **Combined loss function**: Implementing Dice loss (region-based) and Focal loss (pixel-based) to address pixel-level imbalance
3. **Data augmentation**: Applying rotations, shifts, flips, and zooms to increase the effective dataset size and improve generalization

The notebook analysis showed this approach yielded:

```
Found 1094 samples with tumors
Found 1902 samples without tumors
Balanced dataset: 1094 tumor + 1902 no-tumor samples
```

This more balanced distribution significantly improved the model's ability to detect and segment tumor regions.

### 3.3 Model 1: Basic U-Net Architecture

The first model implemented was a standard U-Net architecture, which follows the original encoder-decoder design with skip connections. This architecture was chosen for its proven effectiveness in medical image segmentation tasks.

    outputs = layers.Conv2D(1, 1, activation='sigmoid')(c6)
    model = models.Model(inputs, outputs)
    return model
```

- **Callbacks**: ModelCheckpoint to save best model, EarlyStopping with patience=5

### 3.4 Model 2: Improved U-Net with Attention

The second model implemented significant architectural improvements to address the challenges of bone tumor segmentation:

#### 3.3.1 Architectural Enhancements

The improved U-Net incorporated several key enhancements:

- **Attention gates**: Added at each decoder level to focus on relevant regions
- **Deeper architecture**: Increased depth with 4 encoding/decoding blocks
- **Regularization**: Added batch normalization and dropout to prevent overfitting
- **Enhanced convolutional blocks**: Two convolutional layers with batch normalization

    model = models.Model(inputs, outputs)
    return model
```

#### 3.3.2 Custom Loss Functions

To address the class imbalance issue, we implemented specialized loss functions:

- **Dice loss**: To focus on overlap between predicted and ground truth regions
- **Focal loss**: To give more weight to hard-to-classify examples
- **Combined loss**: A weighted combination of dice loss and focal loss

```python
def dice_loss(y_true, y_pred, smooth=1e-6):
    """Dice loss for segmentation"""
    y_true_f = K.flatten(y_true)
    y_pred_f = K.flatten(y_pred)
    intersection = K.sum(y_true_f * y_pred_f)
    return 1 - (2. * intersection + smooth) / (K.sum(y_true_f) + K.sum(y_pred_f) + smooth)

def focal_loss(y_true, y_pred, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0):
    """Focal loss to handle class imbalance"""
    epsilon = K.epsilon()
    y_pred = K.clip(y_pred, epsilon, 1.0 - epsilon)
    
    # Calculate focal loss
    pt = tf.where(K.equal(y_true, 1), y_pred, 1 - y_pred)
    alpha_t = tf.where(K.equal(y_true, 1), alpha, 1 - alpha)
    focal_weight = alpha_t * K.pow(1 - pt, gamma)
    focal_loss = -focal_weight * K.log(pt)
    
    return K.mean(focal_loss)

def combined_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    """Combination of dice loss and focal loss"""
    return dice_loss(y_true, y_pred) + focal_loss(y_true, y_pred)
```

#### 3.3.3 Enhanced Training Strategy

The improved model utilized a more sophisticated training approach:

- **Data augmentation**: Rotation, shifting, flipping, and zooming to increase effective dataset size
- **Class balancing**: Ensuring equal representation of tumor and non-tumor samples
- **Learning rate scheduling**: Reducing learning rate when plateauing
- **Custom metrics**: Tracking Dice coefficient and IoU during training
- **Initial learning rate**: 1e-4 (lower than default to ensure stable convergence)
- **Enhanced callbacks**: Monitoring Dice coefficient with patience=10

## 4. Experimental Results

### 4.1 Evaluation Metrics

To comprehensively evaluate model performance, we utilized multiple metrics:

- **Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)**: Measures overlap between predicted and ground truth masks
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**: Measures the overlap ratio of prediction and ground truth
- **Sensitivity**: The ability to correctly identify tumor regions
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Hausdorff Distance**: Measures the maximum distance between predicted and ground truth boundaries
- **Area Under ROC Curve (AUC)**: Overall discriminative ability

### 4.2 Basic U-Net Results

The basic U-Net model achieved the following performance on the validation set:

- **Mean Dice**: 0.000
- **Mean IoU**: 0.505
- **Mean Sensitivity**: 0.000
- **Mean F1-score**: 0.000

These results indicate that the basic model failed to properly segment tumor regions, despite training for multiple epochs. The high IoU value with zero Dice score suggests that the model primarily predicted empty masks or background, which is a common failure mode in highly imbalanced segmentation tasks.

**Final Training Metrics (Basic Model):**
```
Epoch 20: val_loss improved from 0.04367 to 0.04133, saving model to best_unet_segmentation.h5
Final results: accuracy: 0.9881 - loss: 0.0451 - val_accuracy: 0.9890 - val_loss: 0.0413
```

These metrics reveal that while the model achieved high overall accuracy (98.9% on validation), this is misleading due to the class imbalance. The model essentially predicts mostly background pixels correctly, but fails to identify the actual tumor regions.

![Training Curves Basic Model](report_figures/model_training_curves.png)
*Figure 8: Training and validation loss and accuracy curves for the basic U-Net model showing poor convergence*

### 4.3 Improved U-Net Results

The improved U-Net demonstrated significantly better performance compared to the basic model.

**Final Training Metrics (Improved Model):**
```
Epoch 4: val_dice_coefficient improved from 0.41796 to 0.43905, saving model to __improved_best_unet_segmentation.h5
Final results: accuracy: 0.9870 - dice_coefficient: 0.3960 - iou_metric: 0.2741 - loss: 0.6262 - val_accuracy: 0.9888 - val_dice_coefficient: 0.4391 - val_iou_metric: 0.2960 - val_loss: 0.5858 - learning_rate: 1.0000e-04
```

The improved model achieved a validation Dice coefficient of 0.4391 and IoU of 0.2960 during training, which is substantially better than the basic model. While the overall accuracy remains high at 98.88% (similar to the basic model), the critical difference is in the segmentation metrics (Dice and IoU) that actually measure tumor detection performance.

To optimize the model's performance further, we conducted a comprehensive threshold analysis on the validation set. Different threshold values were applied to the model's probability outputs to determine the optimal threshold for segmentation:

| Threshold | Dice Score | IoU Score | Sensitivity | F1-Score |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 0.5       | 0.117      | 0.531     | 0.263      | 0.117    |
| 0.1       | 0.122      | 0.528     | 0.284      | 0.122    |
| 0.01      | 0.126      | 0.487     | 0.315      | 0.126    |
| 0.001     | 0.135      | 0.329     | 0.395      | 0.135    |
| 0.0001    | 0.061      | 0.037     | 0.885      | 0.061    |

Analysis of various thresholds revealed that the optimal threshold was 0.001, which achieved the best balance of metrics. This unusually low threshold value suggests that the model was producing low confidence predictions for tumor regions, likely due to the challenging nature of the dataset.

The ROC curve analysis confirmed the model's discriminative ability with an AUC of 0.939, indicating excellent performance despite the challenging segmentation task. This high AUC value demonstrates the model's strong capability to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor pixels.

## 5. Discussion and Analysis

### 5.1 Training Curve Analysis

Analysis of the training curves from both models reveals significant insights into their learning behavior and performance:

1. **Loss Curves**:
   - The basic U-Net's loss drops rapidly in the first few epochs but then plateaus, suggesting limited learning capacity
   - The improved U-Net shows a more steady decrease in loss over time, indicating continued learning
   - The validation loss closely follows the training loss in the improved model, suggesting good generalization without overfitting

2. **Accuracy Curves**:
   - Both models achieve high accuracy (>98%) very quickly
   - This high accuracy is misleading due to class imbalance (most pixels are background)
   - The nearly identical accuracy between models despite vastly different segmentation performance confirms that accuracy alone is not a reliable metric for this task

3. **Dice Coefficient Curves**:
   - The basic U-Net model shows minimal improvement in Dice score, remaining near zero throughout training
   - The improved U-Net shows steady improvement in Dice coefficient, reaching approximately 0.44 on validation data
   - This stark difference demonstrates the effectiveness of the attention gates and specialized loss functions

4. **IoU Curves**:
   - Similar pattern to Dice scores, with the improved model showing consistent improvement
   - The validation IoU of approximately 0.30 demonstrates successful tumor region identification
   - The basic model's high IoU but near-zero Dice score indicates it primarily predicted background

### 5.2 ROC Curve Analysis

The ROC curve for the improved model shows an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.939, which indicates excellent discriminative ability. This high value suggests that despite the challenges of the segmentation task, the model is highly capable of distinguishing between tumor and non-tumor pixels when evaluated at the pixel level.

Key insights from the ROC curve:

1. **High AUC Value**: The area under the curve of 0.939 indicates superior discriminative performance
2. **Optimal Threshold Identification**: The curve helps identify that lower thresholds (0.0015) provide better sensitivity for tumor detection
3. **Tradeoff Visualization**: The curve clearly shows the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity at different threshold values
4. **Model Validation**: The smooth curve with consistently high true positive rate confirms that the model's predictions are reliable across different operating points

### 5.3 Architectural Comparison

Comparing the metrics from both models clearly demonstrates the advantages of the improved U-Net architecture:

| Metric | Basic U-Net | Improved U-Net |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Validation Accuracy | 0.9890 | 0.9888 |
| Validation Loss | 0.0413 | 0.5858 |
| Validation Dice Coefficient | ~0.000 | 0.4391 |
| Validation IoU | ~0.505 | 0.2960 |

While accuracy is similar for both models (due to class imbalance), the improved U-Net shows dramatically better Dice coefficient, which is the most relevant metric for segmentation tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the clear advantages of the improved U-Net architecture over the basic implementation:

1. **Attention mechanism**: Allowed the model to focus on relevant regions, crucial for small tumor areas
2. **Batch normalization**: Improved training stability and convergence
3. **Deeper architecture**: Provided more capacity to learn complex features
4. **Dropout regularization**: Prevented overfitting despite the relatively small dataset

### 5.2 Impact of Loss Functions

The combined loss function (Dice + Focal) proved essential for addressing the severe class imbalance:

1. **Dice loss**: Focused on the overlap between prediction and ground truth, making it less sensitive to imbalance
2. **Focal loss**: Gave more weight to difficult examples, helping the model learn from challenging tumor cases
3. **Combined approach**: Balanced pixel-wise classification with region-based segmentation

### 5.3 Threshold Analysis

Our comprehensive threshold analysis revealed several important insights:

1. **Optimal threshold (0.001)**: Much lower than the typical 0.5, indicating low prediction confidence
2. **Sensitivity-specificity tradeoff**: Lower thresholds increased sensitivity at the expense of specificity
3. **Impact on metrics**: Dice and F1 scores peaked at 0.001, while IoU decreased at very low thresholds

This suggests that the model was producing soft predictions with low confidence for tumor regions, likely due to the ambiguity in X-ray images and the small size of tumor regions.

### 5.4 Limitations and Challenges

#### 5.4.1 Dataset Limitations

1. **Insufficient data volume**: Despite having 3,746 X-ray images, this is relatively small for deep learning applications, particularly given the complexity of the segmentation task
2. **Limited tumor examples**: Only about 50% of images contained tumor annotations, resulting in only ~1,900 actual tumor samples for training
3. **Anatomical heterogeneity**: Images covered various body parts (tibia, femur, hip bone, etc.), creating significant variability in appearance and context
4. **Inconsistent imaging protocols**: Variations in X-ray acquisition parameters, exposure settings, and positioning were not standardized
5. **Annotation quality**: Variability in annotation precision and consistency across different annotators
6. **Limited metadata utilization**: We didn't fully leverage available metadata (age, gender, tumor type) in the modeling approach

#### 5.4.2 Technical Challenges

1. **Small tumor regions**: Tumor areas typically occupied a small fraction of the image (<5%), creating extreme pixel-level class imbalance
2. **X-ray ambiguity**: Inherent difficulty in distinguishing tumor boundaries in X-ray images due to overlapping tissues and structures
3. **2D limitations**: Using only 2D X-rays limited the ability to capture the full 3D tumor structure
4. **Feature complexity**: Bone tumors exhibit high variability in appearance, size, and texture
5. **Domain-specific challenges**: Medical image segmentation requires specific domain knowledge that may not be fully captured by general computer vision approaches

#### 5.4.3 Computational and Time Constraints

1. **Hardware limitations**: Training was performed on consumer-grade hardware with limited GPU memory, constraining batch sizes and model complexity
2. **Training time**: Each model required several hours to train, limiting the number of experiments and hyperparameter tuning iterations
3. **Epoch constraints**: Due to time limitations, models were trained for relatively few epochs (20 for basic U-Net, 15 for improved U-Net)
4. **Limited cross-validation**: Resource constraints prevented comprehensive k-fold cross-validation
5. **Model size restrictions**: Memory limitations restricted the maximum model depth and feature dimensions

These various constraints likely impacted the final model performance. With a larger, more homogeneous dataset and more computational resources, both models could potentially achieve better results through:

- Training on specific anatomical regions separately
- More extensive hyperparameter optimization
- Larger batch sizes for more stable gradient updates
- More training epochs to ensure full convergence
- Deeper or wider network architectures
- Ensemble approaches combining multiple models

## 6. Future Considerations

### 6.1 Architectural Improvements

Future work could explore several promising directions:

1. **Transfer learning**: Utilizing pre-trained models on medical imaging datasets
2. **3D segmentation**: Incorporating multiple views or slices when available
3. **Advanced architectures**: Implementing recent developments like TransUNet (transformer-based)
4. **Multi-scale approaches**: Handling tumors of varying sizes more effectively

### 6.2 Training Strategies

Enhanced training approaches could include:

1. **Semi-supervised learning**: Leveraging unlabeled data
2. **Active learning**: Prioritizing annotation of informative examples
3. **Hard negative mining**: Focusing on difficult cases during training
4. **Progressive training**: Starting with easier examples and gradually introducing harder ones

### 6.3 Clinical Integration

For practical clinical application, further work is needed in:

1. **Interpretability**: Providing explanations for segmentation decisions
2. **Uncertainty estimation**: Quantifying confidence in predictions
3. **Integration with diagnostic workflow**: Ensuring seamless incorporation into clinical practice
4. **Multi-class segmentation**: Distinguishing between different types of bone tumors

## 7. Conclusion

This experimental study compared two U-Net variants for bone tumor segmentation in X-ray images. The improved U-Net with attention mechanisms, combined with specialized loss functions and training strategies, demonstrated superior performance over the basic implementation.

Our findings highlight the importance of architectural design, loss function selection, and threshold optimization in medical image segmentation tasks. While the overall performance remains modest (best Dice score of 0.135), the insights gained provide a valuable foundation for further research in this challenging domain.

The experiment underscores the inherent difficulties in X-ray image segmentation for bone tumors and suggests that future advances may require not only architectural innovations but also improvements in data collection, annotation quality, and potentially the incorporation of multiple imaging modalities.
